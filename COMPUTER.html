He is an English mathematician and inventor credited with having conceived the first automatic digital computer. During the mid-1830s Babagge developed for analytical engine although it was never completed, the forerunner of the modern digital computer. The device is capable of performing any arithmetical operation, a memory unit in which stores number, sequential control and most of other basic elements of the modern computer. The memory unit was to be large enough to hold 50-digits numbers; this was larger than the storage capacity of any computer built before 1960. The machine was to be steam-driven and run by one attendant.</p>
    <p class="lead mt-1">In 1843 Babbage's friend; mathematician Ada Lovelace translated a french paper about the Analytical Engine, she publish how it could perform a sequence of calculations, the first <span style="color: blue;">computer program</span>. The Analytical Engine was forgotten until his unpublished notebooks were discovered in 1937.</p>
